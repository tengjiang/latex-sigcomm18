Traditionally, page faults have been handled by the kernel, with a fixed set of handling routines for different types of faults. However, some applications may benefit from custom page fault handling routines, allowing them to implement advanced functionality, such as more efficient live virtual machine migration and application checkpointing. To this end, Linux introduced the \texttt{userfaultfd()} syscall, which allows applications to handle their page faults in userspace. While \texttt{userfaultfd()} has proven useful in several applications, we identify some key scalability limitations in its design, which limit both performance and adoption. We propose a system that allows using eBPF programs to handle page faults in-kernel, yielding a simpler and more scalable implementation while also enabling novel use cases, such as accelerating start-up of large position-independent executables.
